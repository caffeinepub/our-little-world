# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix message sender display to show "Takshi" and "Aashi" instead of "unknown", restrict admin panel access to Takshi only, and implement automatic daily question rotation.

**Planned changes:**
- Display "Takshi" and "Aashi" as sender names in chat messages instead of "unknown"
- Apply consistent sender name display across all pages (ChatPage, DailyCheckInPage, ReactionsPage)
- Restrict admin panel access and visibility exclusively to Takshi
- Implement automatic daily question generation or scheduling system

**User-visible outcome:** Messages consistently show "Takshi" or "Aashi" as senders throughout the app, only Takshi can access the admin panel, and users see a new daily check-in question automatically every day without manual intervention.
