  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements with comprehensive coverage across frontend and backend. REQ-1 and REQ-2 are fully implemented with localStorage-based fallback for displaying 'Takshi' and 'Aashi' names across all pages. REQ-3 is completely implemented with admin access restrictions in multiple components. REQ-4 is partially implemented with backend infrastructure for scheduled questions, but lacks evidence of automatic daily rotation logic.",

      "requirement": "Implement automatic daily question generation or scheduling to ensure a new question appears every day",
      "reason": "Backend adds scheduledQuestions map and CRUD operations, but diff shows no evidence of automatic daily rotation logic, cron job, timer, or mechanism to automatically activate scheduled questions each day without manual intervention",
